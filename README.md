## DPlatform goals
- Simplicity: Easy automated installation. Manage your applications simply through an UI

- Security: One user is created per app. Severals use encryption and reverse-proxying

- Manage Apps Services - SystemD services integration: view apps services status, one click start/stop, auto-start at boot and auto-restart if down unexpectively
- Update/Remove installed apps simply with two clicks

 +A mystery

## Installation
To begin with DPlatform, run this command:

`wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFabric/DPlatform-ShellCore/master/init.sh | sudo sh`

or

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DFabric/DPlatform-ShellCore/master/init.sh | sudo sh`

The prerequisites will be installed and the DPlatform git project cloned for you.

Next times, to run DPlatform:
`sudo sh init.sh`

Not recommended because no auto-updates: Note you *can* directly run `dplatform.sh`.

## Requirements
A recent GNU/Linux operating system with **SystemD** is recommended, lots of apps have custom SytemdD services.

Debian 8 Jessie and derivatives like Ubuntu and Raspbian. Full support, well tested

If you use Ubuntu 14.04.x and you want to use SystemD services provided by DPlatform, you can switch to it instead of the default Upstart

CentOS 7, Fedora and other RHEL derivatives. Good support, not fully tested

Arch Linux. Partial support, not tested

A x86, x86-64 or ARMv[6,7,8] CPU.

Development is still active. Most things should work, but problems could occur, more testing is needed.
Please feel free to open an issue and create a pull request, all contributions are welcome!

## Roadmap
 - [1] Install apps efficiently through a terminal UI - In progress
 - (2) DPlatform Web GUI to manage apps easily - Early prototypes started
 - (3) Build a custom image with DPlatform Web GUI auto-configuration - Planned
 - DNS and secure firewall pass-through via [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/)
 - Enhance the security. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), Nginx reverse proxy, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate

### Other informations
Each app have its own dedicated user, most their own `/home/app_user` directory
